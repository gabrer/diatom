
DIATOM - Disentangled Adversarial Neural Topic Model
===================

This is a repository for the NAACL 2021 paper:\
*A Disentangled Adversarial Neural Topic Model for Separating Opinions from Plots in User Reviews*


## Description ##
This repository provides:
- a PyTorch implementation of the **DIATOM** core architecture;
- an extract of the annotated sentences from the **MOBO** dataset.

The MOvie and BOok reviews dataset is a collection made up of movie and book reviews, paired with their related plots. The reviews come from different publicly available datasets: the Stanford's IMDB movie reviews [1], the GoodReads [2] and the Amazon reviews dataset [3].
With the help of 15 annotators, we further labeled more than 18,000 reviews' sentences (~6000 per corpus), marking the sentence polarity (*Positive*, *Negative*), or whether a sentence describes its corresponding movie/book *Plot*, or none of the above (*None*). 
In the `dataset` folder, we have shared an excerpt of the annotated sentences for each dataset.

Further details on the data annotation process and inter-annotator agreement are available in the paper.
